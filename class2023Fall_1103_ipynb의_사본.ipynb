        "### **1. Setting up FastAPI**\n",
        "\n",
        "To get started with FastAPI, you need to install it:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "!pip install fastapi[all]\n",
        "!pip install uvicorn\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "### **2. Creating a Simple API with FastAPI**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's build a simple API that returns a greeting message.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "To run the FastAPI app, you need `uvicorn`. In a local environment, you'd use the terminal, but in Google Colab, you'd have to find another way because `uvicorn` runs indefinitely. Here's how you can do it:\n",

        "### **4. Creating a Test Dummy Client**\n",
        "\n",
        "To test data transfer between a client and the server, we'll use Python's `requests` library to create a dummy client.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, let's install the necessary library:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "import requests\n",
        "\n",
        "response = requests.get(\"http://0.0.0.0:8000/\")\n",

        "---\n",
        "## **Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "With FastAPI, you can quickly set up server-side applications. Data transfer between the client and server can be effortlessly tested using Python's `requests` library."
